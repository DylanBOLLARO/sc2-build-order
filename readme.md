# Description

sc2-build-order is a PC application which allows during an sc2 game to display a build order on the screen in superposition (like the discord interface with a transparency), in this way the player no longer has need to do alt-tabs or look at a second screen.

# Use

The interface consists of two parts, the first is the display of the build order, where you must first have selected the race played, the race of the opponent and the build order that you want to do. Then just start the stopwatch, the spot to be made will be orange, the others green, the system leaves the last two spots so that if the players are slightly late they can still follow the soundtrack, there is also the ability to pause the timer (see shortcuts).
